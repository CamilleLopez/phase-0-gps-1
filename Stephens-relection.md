# Reflection Time #

1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  * I am still having some trouble understanding the push, pull, merge concepts, and its connectivity to Github. Still fuzzy on some of the vocab too. 

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  * These concepts were discussed and utilized in our GPS. Brittany was very helpful with this and answered my questions on the matter.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  * I asked multiple questions to my pair concerning the challenge/task at hand. These were aimed to help complete the assignment and pertained to the task at hand. These questions would change too depending on if I was the driver or navigator. If I was the driver my questions would be aimed at asking what we should do next, help my pair contribute to the coding taking place. If I were the navigator I would ask questions to help guide the driver.
  * I asked my guide about standard protocols for Git I was confused on. Like best practice type things. Still figuring out a lot of this, think that practice will make perfect.

4. What still confuses you about Git?
  * Like I have said, still trying to figure out best practices for the git push, pull, merge, fetch, etc. Not that comfortable with pulling down from a remote repo and then cloning or forking. Would like to know the best practice there. Sure it depends on what type of work you are doing.

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  * I loved it! I thought our guide was very helpful, straight forward, and knowledgeable. Would like to have more time to just talk to the guide and ask about their experience with the type of work we are doing. For example, how do they utilize Git in their current work?
  * It is hard to drive and navigate over the internet though. I can see it being very easy in person, sitting right next to each other, but it as clunky over hangouts. Lots of talking over each other by accident, repeating things, etc.
